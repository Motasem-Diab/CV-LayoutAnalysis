# CV-LayoutAnalysis

Page segmentation is the task of decomposing document scans into many different regions such as text, images, tables and graphs. It is the first step in document image recognition and it is still a challenging problem due to the variety of possible document layouts. In this thesis we study an effective method for accomplish the page segmentation phase and improve state of the art in this task. After studying many papers in this field, we introduced a new method that take parts from everywhere. Our method is easy to understand and contains three main stages, firstly, transfer the image to binary image, then filter the binary to text and non-text  binary images, finally, reforming the binary to make blocks that can results a good contours. In this project we will use PRImA Lay- out Analysis Dataset.
